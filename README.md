## Background
The covid-19 pandemic started in 2020 and many people's life got changed by this pandemic. Since the COVID-19 is still a big threat to our daily life, I decided to design and implement an APP that can do a real-time track of the COVID-19 cases all over Canada. SO, that people who live in Canada can get the information about COVID-19 in a more convenient and timely way.

COVID19 TRACKER is my solution for people who want to have more convenient and timely access to the COVID19 information.

Covid19 Tracker is an APP everyone can download on their phones and use to check the detailed information about the covid-19 cases all over Canada and can also be used to check the total cases on the world.
